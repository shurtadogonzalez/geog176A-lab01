I've recently graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a B.A. in Environmental Studies and a minor in Spatial Studies. This past year I took the remote sensing series that helped me look at the environment with a different lens. I was able to work with programs such as ENVI, RStudio, and QGIS. In addition to this, I worked on a project that focused on answering how vegetation in the Zaca Fire scar recovered using a time-series analysis approach.

I hope to continue using spatial and data science as a tool to incorporate into environmental approaches. I look forward to getting more familiar with both GIS and RStudio.
